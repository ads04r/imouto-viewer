			<h1>Welcome to Imouto Viewer</h1>

			<p>
				Imouto Viewer is a system for managing and displaying lifelogs. In order to use it, some additional setup is required.
			</p>

			<h3>Imouto Location Manager</h3>
			<p>
				The main functionality of the viewer requires an instance of
				<a href="https://github.com/ads04r/imouto-location-manager">Imouto Location Manager</a> to be running. Please
				install this, and ensure the <samp>LOCATION_MANAGER_URL</samp> variable in settings_local.py points to the
				location at which this may be accessed.
			</p>

			<h3>Events</h3>
			<p>
				For the viewer to operate, you need to create one or more events. These are generally things than happen
				to you; visits to places, journeys, exercise, or social occasions. However, to start things off, Imouto
				can create an "Installed Imouto Viewer" event automatically by clicking the button below.
			</p>

			<h3>Documentation</h3>
			<p>
				Currently the docs are a work in progress, but keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/ads04r/imouto-viewer/wiki">the
				Github wiki</a> for up-to-date information.
