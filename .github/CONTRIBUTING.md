# Contributing to imouto-viewer / imouto-location-manager

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Project Status

**Imouto is currently under heavy development and is primarily maintained by a single developer.**  
At this stage, the project’s codebase and feature set are rapidly evolving, and breaking changes are frequent.

## Pull Requests

Because of the haphazard nature of development and the limited capacity for code review, **pull requests from external contributors may not be appropriate at this time**. If you have an idea, suggestion, or bug report, please consider opening an issue first to discuss it before submitting code. I may already be working on the same issue.

## Suggestions and Issues

- If you have feedback, feature requests, or encounter bugs, please open an issue with as much detail as possible.
- Discussion and ideas are welcome and appreciated!

## Thank You

Your interest and support are valued. As the project matures, contribution guidelines may be updated to encourage more involvement.
